# Rosie

### Hello my dear, I'm Rosie.

![Rosie](https://github.com/ksgy/rosie-bot/raw/master/assets/images/rosie-avatar.png)

I'm [FOODit](https://github.com/foodit)'s lunch lady. I'm here to help with test orders from restaurants.

## How to order

Join slack channel `#rosies-kitchen` and you can order food like:

```
Rosie order me 3 pizza
Rosie order me 5 bruschetta
```

## TODO

- [ ] Order items with options (you can order food without options atm)
- [ ] Order items from different restaurant (you can only order form `FooditKitchen` atm)
- [ ] Refine command algorithm to recognise `Rosie, order me some pasta`, `Rosie, order me a pizza, two salad and a bruschetta`, etc
- [ ] Move from heroku to somewhere else where Rosie doesn't go to sleep every 30 mins after inactivity


## Dev
Rosie's kitchen is in [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps/rosiebot)'s building now. Let [ksgy](https://github.com/ksgy) know if you need access.
